            <span class="hello">HELLO WINUK COMMUNITY,</span>
            <br />As we are approaching this summer holiday, the need for
            maintaining a good work-life balance increases. <br /><br />Recent
            studies show that women in STEM careers struggle with achieving a
            healthy worklife balance, particularly those who wish to start
            families. The demanding and timeconsuming nature of STEM careers
            sometimes doesn’t overlap with flexible working hours and
            economic/social needs. Unfortunately, the gender pay gap represents
            another limiting factor in overcoming this challenge, resulting in
            more stress and pressure on women who may feel isolated and
            uncomfortable within their work environment. <br /><br />
            At WiNUK we believe in a society that recognises the importance of a
            work-life balance and implements a supportive work environment that
            retains and helps women in STEM careers.

            <p>
              We explored how AI, computation, and technology developments are
              progressing neuroscience research. Our female speakers PhD
              candidate Clementine Domine and Ludmila Kucikova shared their
              neuroscience research and experiences within this field. The
              interactive Q&A allowed attendees to gain valuable insights to
              fuel their neuroscience journey!

            <p>
              The WiNUK Social Media, Content Creators and Graphics teams
              created a series of impactful infographics for June to highlight
              key health awareness initiatives. These include Tourette Syndrome
              Awareness Day, to highlight Tourette Syndrome and promote support
              for those living with the condition. For Migraine and Headache
              Awareness Month, our infographics provided valuable information on
              the prevalence and impact of migraines and headaches, advocating
              for better treatment and awareness. Additionally, for PTSD
              Awareness Month, we focused on raising awareness about
              post-traumatic stress disorder, aiming to reduce stigma and
              promote understanding. Through these visually engaging and
              informative infographics, WiNUK continues to commit to spreading
              awareness and fostering a supportive community.
